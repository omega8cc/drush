The [php:cli command](commands/php_cli.md) is interactive PHP REPL with your bootstrapped site (remote or local). Itâ€™s a Drupal code playground. You can do quick code experimentation, grab some data, or run Drush commands. This can also help with debugging certain issues. See [this blog post](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:gwk2crTHcrcJ:blog.damiankloip.net/2015/drush-php-settings&sca_esv=559191296&hl=en&gl=us&strip=1&vwsrc=0) for an introduction. Run `help` for a list of commands.
